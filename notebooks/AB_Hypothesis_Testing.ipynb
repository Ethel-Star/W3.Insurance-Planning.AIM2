    "##### Metrics Selection : \n",
    "I used Total Claims because our null hypothesis was focused on identifying risk differences across provinces. Total Claims directly measures the amount of risk associated with insurance policies, making it the most appropriate metric for quantifying and comparing risk between regions. This metric aligns with our goal of understanding how the financial impact of claims varies across provinces. In contrast, Total Premium measures revenue, not risk, as it reflects income rather than the actual cost of claims. Margin, representing the difference between Total Premium and Total Claims, indicates profitability but does not directly measure risk; it can be affected by factors such as pricing strategies or operational costs. Therefore, Total Claims is the most relevant metric for assessing risk differences, as it directly reflects the financial impact of claims and provides insights into the frequency and severity of claims across different provinces. Analyzing Total Claims helps identify significant risk variations, whereas Total Premium offers insights into revenue and risk-related pricing.\n",

    "The Chi-Square statistic was 1,214,174.41, indicating a noticeable deviation between observed and expected claim frequencies. However, the p-value was 1.0, suggesting that the observed differences could be entirely due to random chance. Since the p-value is much greater than the common significance threshold of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating no statistically significant relationship between postal code categories and insurance claims. The degrees of freedom were 1,373,514, reflecting the dataset's complexity with numerous postal codes and claim amounts. Expected frequencies were very small, hinting at a highly uneven distribution of claims across postal codes. The results suggest that differences in total claims are likely due to random variation rather than an association with postal codes. This outcome may be attributed to the low number of claims per category and the high number of postal code categories, which can weaken the test's ability to detect significant differences.\n",
